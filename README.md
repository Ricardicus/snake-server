# This is a server hosting snake!
This is a little website that runs the game 'Snake'. 
The server is backed with pythons 'BaseHTTPServer' module.
# To run it on your system:
I only know how to make this run on a mac or Linux machine.
Download all the files and directorys and place them in a directory.
Navigate there using the terminal. 
While there write:
'sudo python myserv.py'
(sudo is needed to create a socket for port 80)

Now you server is up and running! You can shut it down by typing Ctrl-D.
Find out your IP-address and type it in a web browser to visit the page (if you are hosting the server on a local network you might need to configure your router and do 'port forwarding' to make it reachable from a WAN).
